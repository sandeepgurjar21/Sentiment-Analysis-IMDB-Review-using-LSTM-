# Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB-Review-using-LSTM-
The objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model for IMDB movie reviews. The sentiment analysis model will be developed using Python programming language and will be able to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. The project will involve the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful features from the textual data and classify them into positive or negative sentiments.

Project Steps:

Data Collection: The first step is to collect the data from the IMDB dataset. The dataset contains reviews of various movies with their ratings ranging from 1 to 10. We will extract only the reviews and the corresponding sentiment (positive/negative) labels.

Data Pre-processing: In this step, we will perform some pre processing tasks such as removing stop words, stemming, and converting all text to lowercase. We will also tokenize the reviews into words, and then convert the tokens into numerical features using techniques such as bag-of-words or TF-IDF.

Feature Extraction: Next, we will extract features from the pre-processed data. We will use various techniques such as word embeddings, n-grams, and topic modeling to extract meaningful features from the textual data.

Model Selection and Training in this step, we will select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the sentiment analysis task. We will train the model using the pre-processed and feature extracted data We will also evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tools and Technologies Used.

1. Python programming language

2. Jupyter Notebook or Spyder IDE

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as NLTK, Spacy, and Gensim

4. Machine Learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow

5. IMDB movie review dataset

Expected Outcome: The expected outcome of this project is to develop a robust sentiment analysis model for IMDB movie reviews. The model should be able to accurately classify movie reviews as either positive or negative with a high degree of accuracy. This will enable users to obtain quick insights into the sentiment of a particular movie without having to read through a large number of reviews
